怒！兰州老人为救家犬哭着求饶城管，最后群众冷漠围观哭晕在街头，
老人差点连下跪也准备好了，
在送往未知的地狱之前。

An old women almost got ready to knelt down in front of the urben management officier. at least to say goodbye to her dogs who were going to an unkown hell.

让城管善待狗狗是不指望了，想不到连老太婆的情绪安抚工作也没有做好！
如果做好了，老太婆至于哭晕倒地吗？
We don't expect the officers would treat the dogs well even though ,but it is unexpectly that they also didn't comfort the old woman's emotion as well!! 
Or she wouldn't almost get passed out on the ground!

如果连养犬人的人权也保证不了，谁还会去领养？谁还会给流浪动物一个家？谁还会真正为文明白银市贡献？
If there is no right for the dog keepers, who would adopt a dog, who would give the strays a home? who would really contributing to the civilized Baiyin City!

让我们把这一情况反馈到白银市市长热线：0943-12345
Let's feedback this case to the Baiyin City Mayor Hotline!
